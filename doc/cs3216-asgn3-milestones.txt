Phase 1

Milestone 0: @@PB
Describe the problem that your application solves.

We want to make it easy for people to maintain and keep ahead of their daily routines and to-do tasks.
### There are many people who have busy schedules with many to-do tasks to track, and wished that their their to-do task list could manage itself, without much manual intervention or rearrangement.
There are 3 main subsets to this problem.
1. You want to just know what you need to do when you open the app, instead of using some app where you have to click through numerous places just to see what you need to do.
2. You do not want to add tasks and then try to manually arrange them. You should have everything arranged nicely for you, immediately after adding the task to do.
3. Many a times, tasks also do not just take one day to complete, and needs to be kept on the calendar for many days.
Yet it is troublesome to have to keep shifting these tasks.

The way we intend to solve these problems through well-designed interfaces that makes it easy to manage to-do tasks.


Milestone 1: @@PB
Describe your application and explain how you intend to exploit the characteristics of mobile cloud computing to achieve your application’s objectives, i.e. why does it make most sense to implement your application as a mobile cloud application?

It should be a mobile application because you need to be able to refer to your to-do task list on the go, any time anywhere.
It should use the cloud because many interactions happen online and you need to be able to sync those online interactions and to-do tasks into the app.
Another reason is that you should be able to access your data on any device, without having to manually transfer your data, since this syncing can be better done via the cloud.

Milestone 2: @@PB
Describe your target users. Explain how you plan to promote your application to attract your target users.

### Our target users are university students and young working adults who have busy schedules with many to-do tasks to track, and wished that their their to-do list could manage itself, without much manual intervention or rearrangement.
### There are 3 main ways that we can promote the app.
### First, we can allow users to share their schedules and allow other people to add tasks to their schedules. This increases exposure of the app to other people.
### Second, some awesome features are unlockable only after you have invited X number of friends who use the app, which gives the user an incentive to invite more friends.
### Third, further promotion can be done through Facebook/Twitter/Tumblr shares.

MISC NOTES
During the user’s first visit to the site, we will tell the browser to quietly download and save the program for future use.
The Application Cache is how we will instruct it to retain all resources required for this “web page” to run in the absence of an internet connection. When used in conjunction with Web Storage or Web SQL Database, which allow storage of data on the local file system, your application can function like a native one.
After which, the client can operate with limited functionality when it is offline and communicate with the server using AJAX calls while it has internet access. Requests typically take the form of JSON or XML formatted messages and they contain details of a job to be processed by the server, such as querying the database for some information or to update its records.
The server then replies with a similarly formatted message response, which the client is responsible for decoding and notifying the user of.
