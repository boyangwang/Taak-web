###Goodness of Sticky Notes On The Go
Sticky notes work very well as to-do task planners and reminders, but they aren't conveniently portable. You can't exactly carry your physical sticky notes board around with you.

###Full Board Display Even on Mobile (@@)
@@I just thought of this, so let me know if this is good.

@@ Out of sight, out of mind. That's why sticky notes are so effective. They're always pasted somewhere in sight and are a constant reminder of the tasks you need to do.

@@ However, mobile devices have small screens that can only display so much. Many of the sticky notes on the app would be out of sight, and they would lose a key value of acting as a constant reminder.

@@ So we wanted to reproduce this highly valued user experience for the sticky note board on our mobile app. We allow the user to "lock the screen" (have to ask Colin if we can have a empty shell native app to hold the iframe), which triggers the Full Board Display where we automatically scroll through the sticky note board.

###Main Tasks in One Glance
@@@Context or Board Switching

###Sticky Notes Giving
@@Give friends or family sticky notes.

###No Sign-up Required (@@)
@@ A slight expansion from the sharing of a single sticky note.

@@Have a public url

@@Of course, for users who want to have private sticky note boards that are not accessible via a public url, we have also implemented user accounts and a sign-up process.

###Familiar User Experience Ported ($$ shift up?)
Sticky note users love sticky notes because of the ways that they can interact with them. The peeling, the sticking and the marking.

Our app brings all that familiarity into tablet devices. @@@

###Comfortable View & Easy Scrolling
@@We wanted users to feel comfortable viewing a sticky notes board on a tablet device, so we designed and made it very easy to scroll.

###Access on any device
@@Responsive. Landscape or Portrait.
