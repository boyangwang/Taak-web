###Goodness of Sticky Notes On The Go
Sticky notes work very well as to-do task planners and reminders, but they aren't conveniently portable. You can't exactly carry your physical sticky notes board around with you.

###All Tasks In A Glance (Auto-View Display)

Out of sight, out of mind. That's why sticky notes are so effective. They're always pasted somewhere in sight and are a constant reminder of the tasks you need to do.

However, mobile devices have small screens that can only display so much. Many of the sticky notes on the app would be out of sight, and they would lose a key value of acting as a constant reminder.

So we wanted to reproduce this highly valued user experience for the sticky note board on our mobile app. We allow the user to "lock the screen", which triggers the Auto-View Display where we automatically cycle through the sticky note boards.


###Portable Sticky Note Board with Lock-Screen, Viewable Any Time
To maximize the usefulness of the Auto-View Display on a mobile device, it has to be viewable on the go, just like how you would put your time table on one side of your clear hardcover plastic folder, for easy viewing any time on the go.

However, this display should also prevent accidental unintended mistouches when the user is moving around.

Although mobile devices have their native lock screens, the user will not be able to view the sticky notes board on them.

Hence, we made a lock-screen feature on our app, so that the Sticky Note Board can always be in view.

When you lock the screen, the app is locked down and all usual buttons are disabled.


###Animated & Prominent Unlock Mechanism
To unlock the screen, simply touch the screen to activate the unlock-prompt, and touch the unlock-prompt 3 times. We made the unlock-prompt especially prominent so that it is impossible for users to miss it:

* Upon touching the locked screen, the screen has a black tint, which hints to the user that something (the unlock mechanism) has been triggered.
* It has a animated glowing circle that indicates the spot you should touch.
* The touch areas happen at 3 different spots so that it greatly reduces the chances for accidental mistouches to unlock the screen.
* It prominently displays the score count, so that you can easily see the remaining number of touches required before the screen is unlocked.
* Once you have made the 3 correct touches, the glowing circle will have a flashing animation.
* In the event that it is a mistouch, the unlock-prompt disappears after 5 seconds and resets the number of touches required before unlock.

Due to the varying support for Canvas, this only works on Desktops and Apple mobile devices, and does not work well on Android mobile devices, hence this is removed and unavailable for Android devices.
