# Tower Defense Technical Details

## Entities

Blobs - the ones you want to take down.
Defense - things that can hit blobs

## Game Engine

The engine reads from the `sprites` property and calls update and draw on all of them.
The engine has a `blobs` property used by `defense` class to issue damage on nearby blobs.

It is expected that the engine would soon support TMX-format/JSON files from Tiled editor.

## Tile Engine

The tile engine used is a simple 2D engine. However, it can be ported to the standard isometric layout.

TileSets are to be used for the map and sprites for efficient rendering.

The tile engine uses two grid systems. The tile grid system is the one that is to be used for AI and maps. The draw grid system is used by the engine to position tiles and textures.

For a simple 2D engine, 1 unit on the tile grid is equal to 32 units on draw grid. For isometric engines, the grid system would be slightly different.

## Pathing

All blobs will follow a path defined in the `path` property. The path provides a function to convert distance travelled into position. This is done so that all objects with the same `path` object will follow the same path. This method allows objects to travel at different speeds.

	Position of object = F(distance traveled by object).

## Map

The map is defined as a 2D grid, each value corresponding to a "global" tile index.
